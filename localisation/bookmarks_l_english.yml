 A_TOWN_CALLED_PRIPYAT_DESC:0 "Turn it off. Turn off the cooling unit. We are to make a routine inspection. This is standard procedure, don't waste our time."
 VOZHD_DESC:0 "Questions have started to form. Where is Stalin? The now 74 year old dictator are spending more and more time in his vacation home, and within the politburo a secret preparation for the worst is in place. Who will take over? Is this the last days of the Vozhd?"

 CUBANO_DESC:0 "Cruel leaders are replaced only to have new leaders turn cruel. Such is the capitalist and selfish society. But change is coming. The people are tired of being the backyard of a american empire and a corrupt elite. The revolution is here."
 DEATH_OF_EMPIRES_DESC:0 "The sun never sets on the British Empire but it's light is fading. But it stands not alone; it may have lost it's crown jewel but at least it fares better than France, a empire now not worth more than its name. For now at least."
 FNG_DESC:0 "A man enters the forest and another man leaves. Why are we here? What are we fighting for? Bombs are falling constantly and my friends are dying by the hundreds. But wait; what is that? A click, a scream; that american kid's gun is jammed!"
 PETROLEUM_DESC:0 "The black vein that keeps us running has dried up. The Arabs are heads over Israels actions, and now they are refusing to sell their oil. What do we do? Our industries are at a standstill and our cars are stopped! We need more oil!"
 TEHRAN_BAGHDAD_DESC:0 "When old wounds run deep a people will hate eachother for a reason no one knows. Shia and Sunni has been at peace, but this is threatened by the foul Iranians and their so called Islamic Republic. We must strike fast."
 THE_CALM_BEFORE_THE_STORM_DESC:0 "The year everything seemed fine. The cold war is getting warmer, poor nations are improving and everything is becoming better. What a great year to be alive; there is even some cool movies in the making!"
 THE_RED_DRAGON_DESC:0 "Eastern asia, a land of endless civil wars. First the Chinese, then the Koreans. At last none can question who is the legitimate Chinese government. Maoism has prevailed! Socialism has won!"
 THE_STANDOFF_DESC:0 "Let's play a game they both said. It's not as if we can lose. The other guy will back off, it is to risky, they both said. They can't be that dumb. And troughout this, the nukes was armed."
 THE_WALL_DESC:0 "With the USSR in economic collapse our chance is here! We will not let our country be divided no more! Decades have family, friends and a people been separated; Tear down this wall! "
 TWO_MINUTES_TO_MIDNIGHT_DESC:0 "A thousand one, a thousand two. The man at the radar sees something approaching. He knows his orders. But is it false? Is it a mistake? What if the rader is wrong? A loud click, and the clock moves it's hand."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Britan emerged victorious from the war against the Axis, but soon after rejoice changed into bitterness. Internal struggle, the loss of the Crown Jewel of the British Empire and a call for decolonization from it's colonies have left Britan in a precarious spot. \n\nOn the horizon dark storms are gathering, and on it's current course the great Empire will fade into the mists of past glory."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Established as a member of the great five victors of the war, France looks as if it remains a great power, but under the surface the rust and grime of what that has passed a disease is still present. \n\nIn need to rebuild and restructure France is in a political turmoil, and there are many former colonies that have tired of french rule and whom stand at the edge of leaving a once wast and powerful empire."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Motherland, the Giant and the Victor of the Great Patriotic war have risen from it's ashes into a superpower. \n\nThe occupation of eastern Europe, the destruction of Germany and the rapid industrialization during the war has put the USSR in a position it finds hard to control. \n\nA generation of workers have been lost, but socialism have prevailed!"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The USA is in a position which takes great precision. Germany, Italy and Japan have all been defeated in the Air, Land and Sea, and the USA is no longer a isiolonist country, but a global superpower. \n\nNo longer in a depression, but with a intact economy capable of mass production the future for the USA is looking bright, but there are some issues. \n\nThe USA is not the only nation to find themselves in a position of great power, and as such must work to maintain it."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 ""Communism is not love. Communism is a hammer which we use to crush the enemy." - Chairman Mao \n\nCommunism in China has prevailed. The PRC controls China, and with only a weak ROC on a total retreat the civil war in China is nearing it's end.\n\nNo longer a puppet of the west, and no longer the large and the weak, China will become great! No longer will we be stepped on, and no longer will we be abused!"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 WGR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A war lost, a people split. No discussions have been made on what side that got the better deal. Stumped, rebuilding and weakened Germany lingers on crimes of the past. \n\nSoon Germany will be reunited again, but until then we will have to stand the humiliation of occupation."
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Neutrality is a feeble protection. No one can deny that Turkey is of great strategic value. As the bridge between West and East, Turkey will have to take a stand. \n\nWill we stand up for our great nation, pick a side or dissapear from the scene of history when the unevitable conflict arises between powers Turkey cannot rival."
 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Commonwealth is a joke. A crude disease exploiting the weak and conquered. Opinion of the British Empire is low, and nationalist movements are brewing under the surface. But the world's eyes are on Egypt, and the Suez canal. The West will not easily let it go, and Egypt will be free."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A constitution for freedom is done! Rejoice! \n\nNo longer a puppet to the UK, but the worlds largest free and democratic state the future for India is looking bright. But all is not well. Under a shining surface problems of old and new swirls. \n\nPoverty, illiteracy, poor infrastructure and more is plaguing the nation, and it will take a lot for India before they can claim to have freed themselves from the past."
 PAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Newly formed and recognized, the future of Pakistan looks menacing. Parts of India are demanding that we join them again, and while we are numerous our state is weak.

 NKR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The ancient nation of Korea suffered terribly under decades of Japanese occupation, but now Kim Il-Sung and the Down-with-Imperialism Union have won its freedom. This magnificent victory, however, has been sullied by Cold War politics, and the Western imperialists have established a second Korean state in the South to challenge the Great Leader. This partition cannot be tolerated, and the Korean People's Army must prepare to liberate the South and reunify the nation..."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As a nation located in a most strategic geographical spot, the people of Poland has once more lost their rights. After defeating the Nazis and the promises of freedom once again, we have been decieved. \n\nThere are no plan to give us a true stateright and some of our citizens are beggining to face a fact, or face a syndrome of capture."
 DDR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Occupied, abused and hated the people of East Germany scrapes by. Most of them did no wrong, but all are they punished. \n\nThe Soviets have not been kind to those who could not escape, and a regime has been placed that accurately represents the peoples wish for socialism. But we fear not, because soon Germany will be reunited again, and the nation can truly recover from the crimes of our past."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "The Ideological Crusade"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Years of decolonization, civil wars and resistance movements are plaguing the former colonies. Nations once no more than colonies are freeing themselves from the shackles of their oppressors, and a golden age is coming to Africa and Asia! The question is now not if they will be free, but who they will align with once they are. "
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 ""
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
